# GUI vs. CLI – Comparison 
Usually when I use git, I either use VSCode’s source control or just the CLI. Github desktop seems very similar to the VSCode GUI; I can view changes as they are added to the repository, and write my commit and push it from a nice GUI. If I were to use the CLI, I’d first track my changes using a git add . command, commit them w/ git commit –m, then push the commit w/ git push –u origin main. Origin being the remote branch, and main being the local branch. Using –u sets the remote branch as the default upstream branch, meaning you don’t have to specify the remote branch each time; you can just use git push and git pull.
