# Randy Pausch's Last Lecture
I found Randy Pausch's lecture very moving, and thought provoking. I really liked his 'brick wall' analogy. In my field of study theres a lot of barriers for entry; you're constantly learning something new. Whether its a technical cert, a tough class, or learning the tech stack used at your job. There's a lot of brick walls to get through, but if you really want to, you'll get through them!
This semester, I'll be studying for another cert exam (Comptia Sec+), building my resume, and preparing myself for an internship. One of Randy's pieces of advice sticks out for me; "Be good at something: it makes you valuable". This is a must in IT, there's a lot of different specialties you can go into. Certs are a good way to prove to employers that you're good at something, or at least you have knowledge on that subject.
