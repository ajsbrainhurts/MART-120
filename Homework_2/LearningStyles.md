# Learning Styles: My thoughts
I think learning styles can vary across different fields. Throughout my time in my major I've done a lot of visual and tactile learning. Labbing is a must in my major. CCNA1-3 had me doing a lot of simulated labs in packet tracer, you build upon those concepts you learn until you're basically building your own little networks. Taking Comptia exams, you're usually expected to complete at least one PBQ (performance based question) where you're set up with a little fake lab environment and you troubleshoot an issue with various devices. In IT, if you don't have this kind of experience it can make doing your job a LOT harder.
